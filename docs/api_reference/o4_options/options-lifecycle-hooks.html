    <h2>beforeCreate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Type: Function</li>
        <li>Details:
            Called synchronously immediately after the instance has been initialized, before data observation and
            event/watcher setup.
        </li>

<section>
    <h2>created</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Type: Function</li>
        <li>Details:
            Called synchronously after the instance is created. At this stage, the instance has finished processing the
            options which means the following have been set up: data observation, computed properties, methods,
            watch/event callbacks. However, the mounting phase has not been started, and the $el property will not be
            available yet.

    <h2>beforeMount</h2>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>mounted</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Type: Function</li>
        <li>Details:
            Called after the instance has been mounted, where element, passed to Vue.createApp({}).mount() is replaced
            by the newly created vm.$el. If the root instance is mounted to an in-document element, vm.$el will also be
            in-document when mounted is called.
            Note that mounted does not guarantee that all child components have also been mounted. If you want to wait
            until the entire view has been rendered, you can use vm.$nextTick inside of mounted:
            <pre><code>
mounted() {
    this.$nextTick(function () {
        // Code that will run only after the
        // entire view has been rendered
    })
    }
            </code></pre>
            <p>This hook is not called during server-side rendering.</p>
        </li>
