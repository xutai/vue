    try vscode live server plugin's "open with live server", it won't work, as the route is something like "http://127.0.0.1:5502/docs/core/o7_scaling_up/routing.html"
    <br><br>
    try use it in the current node.js server, it won't work too, as the route is "http://127.0.0.1:8081/docs/core/o7_scaling_up/routing",
    if i want to set a route, i have to configue node.js routing to let node.js know what to render 
    <br><br>
    it might be possible to use webpack live server, as webpack knows how to compile vue code and 
    knows how to set up routing
