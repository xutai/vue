<p>
    Vue needs to attach event listeners in order to know when a transition has ended.
    It can either be transitionend or animationend, depending on the type of CSS rules applied.
    If you are only using one or the other, Vue can automatically detect the correct type.

    However, in some cases you may want to have both on the same element, for example having a CSS animation triggered by Vue, along with a CSS transition effect on hover.
    In these cases, you will have to explicitly declare the type you want Vue to care about in a type attribute, with a value of either animation or transition.

<div id="demo">
    <button v-on:click="show = !show">
        Toggle
    </button>
    <transition name="fade">
        <p v-if="show">Hello</p>
    </transition>

</div>

<script>

    new Vue({
        el: '#demo',
        data: {
            show: true,
        }
    })


</script>
