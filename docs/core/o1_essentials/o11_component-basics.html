    <h1>Components Basics</h1>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Base Example</h2>
    <p>Here's an example of a Vue component:</p>
    <p class="info">We're showing you a simple example here, but in a typical Vue application we use Single File
        Components instead of a string template. You can find more information about them in this section.</p>
    <p>Components are reusable instances with a name: in this case, &lt;button-counter&gt;. We can use this component as
        a custom element inside a root instance:</p>
    <p>Since components are reusable instances, they accept the same options as a root instance, such as data, computed,
        watch, methods, and lifecycle hooks. The only exceptions are a few root-specific options like el.</p>

</section>
<section>
    <h2>Reusing Components</h2>
    <p>Components can be reused as many times as you want:</p>
    <p>Notice that when clicking on the buttons, each one maintains its own, separate count. That's because each time
        you use a component, a new instance of it is created.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Organizing Components</h2>
    <p>It's common for an app to be organized into a tree of nested components:</p>
    <p>For example, you might have components for a header, sidebar, and content area, each typically containing other
        components for navigation links, blog posts, etc.</p>
    <p>To use these components in templates, they must be registered so that Vue knows about them. There are two types
        of component registration: global and local. So far, we've only registered components globally, using component
        method of created app:</p>
    <p>Globally registered components can be used in the template of app instance created afterwards - and even inside
        all subcomponents of that root instance's component tree.</p>
    <p>That's all you need to know about registration for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel
        comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on Component Registration.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Passing Data to Child Components with Props</h2>
    <p>Earlier, we mentioned creating a component for blog posts. The problem is, that component won't be useful unless
        you can pass data to it, such as the title and content of the specific post we want to display. That's where
        props come in.</p>
    <p>Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. When a value is passed to a prop attribute, it
        becomes a property on that component instance. To pass a title to our blog post component, we can include it in
        the list of props this component accepts, using a props option:</p>
    <p>A component can have as many props as you'd like and by default, any value can be passed to any prop. In the
        template above, you'll see that we can access this value on the component instance, just like with data.</p>
    <p>Once a prop is registered, you can pass data to it as a custom attribute, like this:</p>
    <p>In a typical app, however, you'll likely have an array of posts in data:</p>
    <p>Then want to render a component for each one:</p>
    <p>Above, you'll see that we can use v-bind to dynamically pass props. This is especially useful when you don't know
        the exact content you're going to render ahead of time.</p>
    <p>That's all you need to know about props for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable
        with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on Props</p>

    <h2>Listening to Child Components Events</h2>
    <p>As we develop our &lt;blog-post&gt; component, some features may require communicating back up to the parent. For
        example, we may decide to include an accessibility feature to enlarge the text of blog posts, while leaving the
        rest of the page its default size.</p>
    <p>In the parent, we can support this feature by adding a postFontSize data property:</p>
    <p>Which can be used in the template to control the font size of all blog posts:</p>
    <p>Now let's add a button to enlarge the text right before the content of every post:</p>
    <p>The problem is, this button doesn't do anything:</p>
    <p>When we click on the button, we need to communicate to the parent that it should enlarge the text of all posts.
        Fortunately, component instances provide a custom events system to solve this problem. The parent can choose to
        listen to any event on the child component instance with v-on or @, just as we would with a native DOM event:
    </p>
    <p>Then the child component can emit an event on itself by calling the built-in $emit method, passing the name of
        the event:</p>
    <p>Thanks to the v-on:enlarge-text="postFontSize += 0.1" listener, the parent will receive the event and update
        postFontSize value.</p>
    <p>We can list emitted events in the component's emits option.</p>
    <p>This will allow you to check all the events component emits and optionally validate them</p>

</section>
<section>
    <h3>Emitting a Value With an Event</h3>
    <p>It's sometimes useful to emit a specific value with an event. For example, we may want the <blog-post> component
            to be in charge of how much to enlarge the text by. In those cases, we can use $emit's 2nd parameter to
            provide this value:</p>
    <p>Then when we listen to the event in the parent, we can access the emitted event's value with $event:</p>
    <p>Or, if the event handler is a method:</p>
    <p>Then the value will be passed as the first parameter of that method:</p>


</section>
<section>
    <h3>Using v-model on Components</h3>
    <p>Custom events can also be used to create custom inputs that work with v-model. Remember that:</p>
    <p>does the same thing as:</p>
    <p>When used on a component, v-model instead does this:</p>
    <p class="warning">Please note we used model-value with kebab-case 短横线隔开 here because we are working with in-DOM
        template.
        You can find a detailed explanation on kebab-cased vs camelCased attributes in the DOM Template Parsing Caveats
        section</p>
    <p>For this to actually work though, the &lt;input&gt; inside the component must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bind the value attribute to a modelValue prop</li>
        <li>On input, emit an update:modelValue event with the new value</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's that in action:</p>
    <p>Now v-model should work perfectly with this component:</p>
    <p>Another way of creating the v-model capability within a custom component is to use the ability of computed
        properties' to define a getter and setter.</p>
    <p>In the following example, we refactor the custom-input component using a computed property.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind, the get method should return the modelValue property, or whichever property is being using for
        binding, and the set method should fire off the corresponding $emit for that property.</p>
    <p>That's all you need to know about custom component events for now, but once you've finished reading this page and
        feel comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on Custom Events.</p>

    <h2>Content Distribution with Slots</h2>
    <p>Just like with HTML elements, it's often useful to be able to pass content to a component, like this:</p>
    <p>Which might render something like:</p>
    <p>Fortunately, this task is made very simple by Vue's custom &lt;slot&gt; element:</p>
    <p>As you'll see above, we just add the slot where we want it to go -- and that's it. We're done!</p>
    <p>That's all you need to know about slots for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable

<section>
    <h2>Dynamic Components</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, it's useful to dynamically switch between components, like in a tabbed interface:</p>
    <p>The above is made possible by Vue's component element with the <span class="keyword">is</span> special attribute:
    </p>
    <p>In the example above, currentTabComponent can contain either:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the name of a registered component, or</li>
        <li>a component's options object</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See this sandbox to experiment with the full code, or this version for an example binding to a component's
        options object, instead of its registered name.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that this attribute can be used with regular HTML elements, however they will be treated as
        components, which means all attributes will be bound as DOM attributes. For some properties such as value to
        work as you would expect, you will need to bind them using the <span class="keyword">.prop</span> modifier.</p>
        <p class="question">what ?????????????
            DOM attributes? value to work as you would expected???? bind them using the .prop modifier??
            <br>
            v-bind:value="" vs value=""  ??
        </p>
    <p>That's all you need to know about dynamic components for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel
        comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on Dynamic & Async
        Components.</p>

    <h2>DOM Template Parsing Caveats n. 警告；说明</h2>
    <p>Some HTML elements, such as &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;table&gt; and &lt;select&gt; have restrictions on what
        elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as &lt;li&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, and &lt;option&gt; can only
        appear inside certain other elements.</p>
    <p>This will lead to issues when using components with elements that have such restrictions. For example:</p>
    <p>The custom component &lt;blog-post-row&gt; will be hoisted out as invalid content, causing errors in the eventual
        rendered output. Fortunately, we can use v-is special directive as a workaround:</p>
    <p class="warning">v-is value should be a JavaScript string literal:</p>
    <p>Also, HTML attribute names are case-insensitive, so browsers will interpret any uppercase characters as
        lowercase. That means when you’re using <span class="keyword">in-DOM</span> templates, camelCased prop names and event handler parameters
        need to use their kebab-cased (hyphen-delimited) equivalents:</p>
    <p>It should be noted that these limitations does not apply if you are using <span class="keyword">string templates</span> from one of the
        following sources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>String templates (e.g. template: '...')</li>
        <li>Single-file (.vue) components</li>
        <li>&lt;script type="text/x-template"&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's all you need to know about DOM template parsing caveats for now - and actually, the end of Vue's
        Essentials. Congratulations! There's still more to learn, but first, we recommend taking a break to play with
        Vue yourself and build something fun.</p>
    <p>Once you feel comfortable with the knowledge you've just digested, we recommend coming back to read the full
        guide on Dynamic & Async Components, as well as the other pages in the Components In-Depth section of the
        sidebar.</p>
