    <h2>Creating an Instance</h2>
    <p>Every Vue application starts by creating a new application instance with the createApp function:</p>
    <pre><code>
Vue.createApp(/* options */)
    </code></pre>
    <p>After the instance is created, we can mount it, passing a container to mount method. For example, if we want to
        mount a Vue application on &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;, we should pass #app:</p>
    <pre><code>
Vue.createApp(/* options */).mount('#app')
    </code></pre>
    <p>Although not strictly associated with the MVVM pattern, Vue's design was partly inspired by it. As a convention,
        we often use the variable <abbr title="ViewModel" class="keyword">vm</abbr> (short for ViewModel) to refer to
        our instance.</p>
    <p>When you create an instance, you pass in an options object. The majority of this guide describes how you can use
        these options to create your desired behavior. For reference, you can also browse the full list of options in
        the API reference.</p>
    <p>A Vue application consists of a root instance created with createApp, optionally organized into a tree of nested,
        reusable components. For example, a todo app's component tree might look like this:</p>
    <pre><code>
Root Instance
└─ TodoList
   ├─ TodoItem
   │  ├─ DeleteTodoButton
   │  └─ EditTodoButton
   └─ TodoListFooter
      ├─ ClearTodosButton
      └─ TodoListStatistics
    </code></pre>
    <p>We'll talk about the component system in detail later. For now, just know that all Vue components are also
        instances, and so accept the same options object.</p>

    <h2>Data and Methods</h2>
    <p>When an instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its data to Vue's reactivity system. When the
        values of those properties change, the view will "react", updating to match the new values.</p>
    <p>When this data changes, the view will re-render. It should be noted that properties in data are only reactive if
        they existed when the instance was created. That means if you add a new property, like:</p>
    <p>Then changes to b will not trigger any view updates. If you know you'll need a property later, but it starts out
        empty or non-existent, you'll need to set some initial value. For example:</p>
    <p>The only exception to this being the use of Object.freeze(), which prevents existing properties from being
        changed, which also means the reactivity system can't track changes.</p>
    <p>In addition to data properties, instances expose a number of useful instance properties and methods. These are
        prefixed with $ to differentiate them from user-defined properties. For example:</p>
    <p>In the future, you can consult the API reference for a full list of instance properties and methods.</p>
    <div id="app">
        <code>g: {{ g }}</code>
        <code>b: {{ b }}</code>
        <!-- this will no longer update `foo`! -->
        <button v-on:click="g = 'baz'">Change it</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        console.log("window.Vue", window.Vue)
        // Our data object
        // view!!!
        const data = {
            a: 1,
            c: '',
            d: 0,
            e: false,
            f: [],
            e: null,
            g: Symbol('Object.freeze()')
        }

        // Object.freeze(data)

        // The object is added to the root instance
        // viewModel
        const vm = Vue.createApp({
            data() {
                // return data
                return data
            }
        }).mount('#app')

        // Getting the property on the instance
        // returns the one from the original data
        console.log(vm.a === data.a) // => true

        // Setting the property on the instance
        // also affects the original data
        vm.a = 2
        console.log(vm.a, data.a) // => 2

        vm.b = 'hi'
        console.log("vm.b", vm.b, "data.b", data.b)

        data.b = 'bbb'
        console.log("vm.b", vm.b, "data.b", data.b)

        vm.c = 'vue'
        console.log(vm.c, data.c)

        Object.freeze(data)
        try {
            vm.g = 'freezed'
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e)
        }
        console.log(vm.g, data.g)


        console.log("vm.$data.g", vm.$data.g) 
    </script>
    <p class="note">
        vm.g vs vm.$data.g
        <br>
        vm.g may refers to any property, not only data
        <br>
        vm.$data.g refer to data only
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        <!-- Model - DOM --> ???
        <br>
        View  ---- data {}
        <br>
        ViewModel --- Vue.createApp().mount()
        <br>

    <h2>Instance Lifecycle Hooks</h2>
    <p>Each instance goes through a series of initialization steps when it's created - for example, it needs to set up
        data observation, compile the template, mount the instance to the DOM, and update the DOM when data changes.
        Along the way, it also runs functions called lifecycle hooks, giving users the opportunity to add their own code
        at specific stages.</p>
    <p>For example, the created hook can be used to run code after an instance is created:</p>
    <p>There are also other hooks which will be called at different stages of the instance's lifecycle, such as mounted,
        updated, and unmounted. All lifecycle hooks are called with their this context pointing to the current active
        instance invoking it.</p>
    <p class="tip">Don't use arrow functions on an options property or callback, such as created: () =>
        console.log(this.a) or vm.$watch('a', newValue => this.myMethod()). Since an arrow function doesn't have a this,
        this will be treated as any other variable and lexically looked up through parent scopes until found, often
        resulting in errors such as Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined or Uncaught TypeError:
        this.myMethod is not a function.</p>
    <div id="app2"></div>
    <script>
        // const obj = {
        //     fn: () => {
        //         console.log("this", this)
        //     },
        //     fn2: function() {
        //         console.log("this", this)
        //     }
        // }
        // obj.fn()
        // obj.fn2()

        // const app = Vue.createApp({
        //     data() {
        //         return {
        //             a: 1
        //         }
        //     },
        //     beforeCreate() {
        //         console.log('beforeCreate: Called synchronously immediately after the instance has been initialized, before data observation and event/watcher setup. ')
        //     },
        //     // bad practice
        //     // created: () => console.log(this.a)
        //     created() {
        //         console.log('created: Called synchronously after the instance is created. At this stage, the instance has finished processing the options which means the following have been set up: data observation, computed properties, methods, watch/event callbacks. However, the mounting phase has not been started, and the $el property will not be available yet.')
        //         // `this` points to the vm instance
        //         console.log('a is: ' + this.a) // => "a is: 1"
        //     }
        // })
        // .mount('#app2')
        // console.log(app)
        // console.log(app._component.beforeCreate())
        // console.log(app._component.created())

        // bad practice
        // app.$watch('a', newValue => this.myMethod())
    </script>
    <p class="question">
        when i do not mount the vue instance(Vue.createApp()) to DOM,
        <br>
        vue instance doesn't execute the lifecycle hooks "beforeCreate" and "created",
        <br>
        as the console api doesn't log anything?
