    <p>As the name suggests, the navigation guards provided by vue-router are primarily used to guard navigations either
        by redirecting it or canceling it. There are a number of ways to hook into the route navigation process:
        globally, per-route, or in-component.</p>
    <p>Remember that params or query changes won't trigger enter/leave navigation guards. You can either watch the
        $route object to react to those changes, or use the beforeRouteUpdate in-component guard.</p>

    <p>You can register global before guards using router.beforeEach:</p>
    <pre><code>
const router = new VueRouter({ ... })

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) =&gt; {
  // ...
})
    </code></pre>
    <p>Global before guards are called in creation order, whenever a navigation is triggered.
        <small class="confusing">Guards may be resolved asynchronously, and the navigation is considered pending before
            all hooks have been resolved.</small>
    </p>
    <q>pending adj. 未决定的；行将发生的</q>
    <p>Every guard function receives three arguments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>to: Route</strong>: the target Route Object being navigated to.</li>
        <li><strong>from: Route</strong>: the current route being navigated away from.</li>
        <li><strong>next: Function</strong>: this function must be called to resolve the hook. The action depends on the
            arguments provided to next:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>next()</strong>: move on to the next hook in the pipeline. If no hooks are left, the navigation
                is confirmed.</li>
            <li class="confusing"><strong>next(false)</strong>: abort the current navigation. If the browser URL was
                changed (either manually by the user or via back button), it will be reset to that of the from route.
            </li>
            <li><strong>next('/') or next({ path: '/' })</strong>: redirect to a different location. The current
                navigation will be aborted and a new one will be started. You can pass any location object to next,
                which allows you to specify options like replace: true, name: 'home' and any option used in
                router-link's to prop or router.push</li>
            <li><strong>next(error)</strong>: (2.4.0+) if the argument passed to next is an instance of Error, the
                navigation will be aborted and the error will be passed to callbacks registered via router.onError().
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>You can register a global guard with router.beforeResolve. This is similar to router.beforeEach, with the
        difference that resolve guards will be called right before the navigation is confirmed, after all in-component
        guards and async route components are resolved.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="global-after-hooks">global-after-hooks</h2>
    <p>You can also register global after hooks, however unlike guards, these hooks do not get a next function and
        cannot affect the navigation:</p>
    <pre><code>
router.afterEach((to, from) =&gt; {
    // ...
})
    </code></pre>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="pre-route-guard">pre-route-guard</h2>
    <p>You can define beforeEnter guards directly on a route's configuration object:</p>
    <pre><code>
const router = new VueRouter({
    routes: [
        {
            path: &apos;/foo&apos;,
            component: Foo,
            beforeEnter: (to, from, next) =&gt; {
                // ...
            }
        }
    ]
})
    </code></pre>
    <p>These guards have the exact same signature as global before guards.</p>
    <q>signature 信号</q>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="in-component-guards">in-component-guards</h2>
    <p>Finally, you can directly define route navigation guards inside route components (the ones passed to the router
        configuration) with the following options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>beforeRouteEnter</li>
        <li>beforeRouteUpdate</li>
        <li>beforeRouteLeave</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>
const Foo = {
    template: &grave;...&grave;,
    beforeRouteEnter (to, from, next) {
        // called before the route that renders this component is confirmed.
        // does NOT have access to &grave;this&grave; component instance,
        // because it has not been created yet when this guard is called!
    },
    beforeRouteUpdate (to, from, next) {
        // called when the route that renders this component has changed.
        // This component being reused (by using an explicit &grave;key&grave;) in the new route or not doesn&apos;t change anything.
        // For example, for a route with dynamic params &grave;/foo/:id&grave;, when we
        // navigate between &grave;/foo/1&grave; and &grave;/foo/2&grave;, the same &grave;Foo&grave; component instance
        // will be reused (unless you provided a &grave;key&grave; to &grave;&lt;router-view&gt;&grave;), and this hook will be called when that happens.
        // has access to &grave;this&grave; component instance.
    },
    beforeRouteLeave (to, from, next) {
        // called when the route that renders this component is about to
        // be navigated away from.
        // has access to &grave;this&grave; component instance.
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>The beforeRouteEnter guard does NOT have access to this, because the guard is called before the navigation is
        confirmed, thus the new entering component has not even been created yet.</p>
    <p>However, you can access the instance by passing a callback to next. The callback will be called when the
        navigation is confirmed, and the component instance will be passed to the callback as the argument:</p>
    <pre><code>
beforeRouteEnter (to, from, next) {
    next(vm =&gt; {
        // access to component instance via &grave;vm&grave;
    })
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>Note that beforeRouteEnter is the only guard that supports passing a callback to next. For beforeRouteUpdate and
        beforeRouteLeave, this is already available, so passing a callback is unnecessary and therefore not supported:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
beforeRouteUpdate (to, from, next) {
    // just use `this`
    this.name = to.params.name
    next()
}
    </code></pre>
    <p class="confusing">The leave guard is usually used to prevent the user from accidentally leaving the route with
        unsaved edits. The navigation can be canceled by calling next(false).</p>
    <pre><code>
beforeRouteLeave (to, from, next) {
    const answer = window.confirm('Do you really want to leave? you have unsaved changes!')
    if (answer) {
        next()
    } else {
        next(false)
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>If you are using mixins that add in-component navigation guards, make sure to add the mixin after installing the
        router plugin:</p>
    <pre><code>
Vue.use(Router)

Vue.mixin({
  beforeRouteUpdate(to, from ,next) {
    // ...
  }
})
    </code></pre>
