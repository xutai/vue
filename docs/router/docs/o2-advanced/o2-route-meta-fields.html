    <p>You can include a meta field when defining a route:</p>
    <p>meta pref. 表示“变化”“变换”之义 元标签</p>
    <pre><code>
const router = new VueRouter({
    routes: [
        {
        path: '/foo',
        component: Foo,
        children: [
            {
            path: 'bar',
            component: Bar,
            // a meta field
            meta: { requiresAuth: true }
            }
        ]
        }
    ]
})
    </code></pre>
    <p>So how do we access this meta field?</p>
    <p>First, each route object in the routes configuration is called a route record. Route records may be nested. Therefore when a route is matched, it can potentially match more than one route record.</p>
    <p>For example, with the above route config, the URL /foo/bar will match both the parent route record and the child route record.</p>
    <p>All route records matched by a route are exposed on the $route object (and also route objects in navigation guards) as the $route.matched Array. Therefore, we will need to iterate over $route.matched to check for meta fields in route records.</p>
    <p>An example use case is checking for a meta field in the global navigation guard:</p>
    <pre><code>
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) =&gt; {
    if (to.matched.some(record =&gt; record.meta.requiresAuth)) {
        // this route requires auth, check if logged in
        // if not, redirect to login page.
        if (!auth.loggedIn()) {
        next({
            path: &apos;/login&apos;,
            query: { redirect: to.fullPath }
        })
        } else {
        next()
        }
    } else {
        next() // make sure to always call next()!
    }
})
    </code></pre>
